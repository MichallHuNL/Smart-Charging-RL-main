To get started

1. Open EV_charging_PPO.ipynb
2. run all and that's it!


Notes:

The mathematical problem used as a benchmark is written in --> Linear_optimization_simple.ipynb
To access saved model --> PPO_model_2.1f
To access training logs (e.g., for tensorboard) --> PPO_log_2.1f
Alternate reward formulation --> EV_charging_PPO_alt.ipynb

Install before running the code:
Install anaconda
Create a new viritual environment with Python version 3.10.14: conda create -n <Name_of_the_environment> python=3.10.14
After creating virtual environment activate environment
Afterwards run the following command for the requirments.txt to install
(do note that the requirments.txt should be inside the same directory as the anaconda prompt): conda install --file requirements.txt
